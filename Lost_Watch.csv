Lost Watch,19/09/2023,Student,Aditya Prashanth,"On 18th September, I lost my watch in the playground during the PT period (around 11:00 A.m).
It is a Rolex Submariner, with silver interlocking wrist band, and has a blue timepiece. I request
anyone who has encountered that watch, to lend it back to me or the class teacher of class 12-B. 
Incase, we are unavailable, you could also submit it to the 'Lost and Found' Box near the Physics Lab.

Thanks and Regards
